# Header Comments
Each file should contain a comment at the top of the file that 
* provides the file name
* summarizes the contents of the file
* lists important relationships to other files
* provides a revision log 

Note:
* The comment header should be updated whenever this file is modified. 
* Do not use dates in the revision log.

Do not include header comments for individual functions unless it is 
a complicated function that needs nontrivial documentation.

## Example
```
/**
 * src/platforms/web/components/GameControls.tsx - Game Control Buttons
 * 
 * React component for game control actions (reset and undo).
 * Provides a simple interface for players to control game flow by
 * starting a new game or reverting previous moves.
 * 
 * Relationships:
 * - Receives callback handlers from App.tsx
 * - Uses Redux indirectly through parent component callbacks
 * - Part of the game container layout
 * 
 * Revision Log:
